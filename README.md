Bike-sharing systems have emerged as vital components of sustainable urban transportation networks, offering environmental benefits, reducing traffic congestion, and promoting healthier lifestyles. Effective planning and management of these systems require a deep understanding of user behavior and usage patterns. Launched in June 2013, Chicago's Divvy bike-share system offers a comprehensive dataset for examining urban mobility trends. This study conducts a time series analysis of Divvyâ€™s daily and monthly ridership data from June 2013 to December 2019, segmented by customer and subscriber types. The objective is to uncover key temporal patterns, including seasonality, long-term trends, and user dynamics, to inform operational and strategic decisions
